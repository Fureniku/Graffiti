Other objectives:
- Left-clicking with pen in offhand should work just like right-click with mainhand

Goals for fully editable artblock:
- One pixelgrid (16/32/64/128x)
- One backdrop block (panel behind everything taking an existing block's texture)
- List of text objects
- List of drawn objects
- List of item/blocks drawn
- Bool for each layer for fullbright texture

- Option for position (64th extruded, flush with block, attach to block)
- Bool for edit lock

Canvas Editor UI. Tab for each options:
- Overall block properties (position, backdrop item)
	- Position
	- Backdrop item
	- Lock/unlock
	- Pixel grid
	- Right click option
- Texts
	- Edit a text item object when selected from list
	- Remove object
	- Add new object
- Icons
	- Edit a text item object when selected from list
	- Remove object
	- Add new object
- Item/Blocks
	- Edit a text item object when selected from list
	- Remove object
	- Add new object

Changelog:
	- UI improvements:
		- The grid will now display what's drawn on your block
		- Options will correctly update to server-side changes (such as grid status)
		- Added an export button (see below)
		- The GUI is still not final! It's just a bit more usable as a temporary solution.
		- Text drawing position should now be a bit more accurate
	- Fixed crash when trying to backspace text when there is no text
	- Started on the import/export system. Only exporting is done so far, but I've implemented it into the game now so you can start saving your art straight away.
	I can't absolutely 100% promise the art exported right now will be importable in the future, due to changes I may make - but I'll try and keep it compatable.
	- Floating graffiti blocks no longer provide collision. When backdrops are added, a backdrop will cause collisions.
	- Fixed eraser offseting incorrectly by 1 pixel vertically
	- Fixed eraser missing its crafting recipe
	- Added text formatting options (bold, italic, underline and strikeout)
	- Implemented one alignment option (you can now set graffiti to sit slightly away from a block, or flush with a block)

Caveats:
	- UI is still work in progress and may not be as clean as it should be.
	- Recipes aren't working ideally (they aren't shapeless for pen recolouring, and the base pen only accepts white wool. Blame the recipe system, it'll just take a bit of time to fix)
	- For reasons unknown, underline and strikeout formatting isn't always rendering in the UI (but occasionally does). It'll still render in world just fine though.
