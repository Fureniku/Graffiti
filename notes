BUGS:
- text AO is different to pixel AO

UI work:
- Import/Export submenu
- Magic Pen colour menu


Brushes:
- Paint brush (2x2ish, ignoring scale)
- Paint bucket (fill area)
- Spraycan (RNG over area)
- Watercolour pen (adjusts existing RGB value based on the pen's RGB instead of hard setting)

Changelog:
- More UI improvements:
	- Text which is larger than the single block will be trimmed for neatness in the UI. The text itself is still allowed; I don't like to restrict freedoms :)
	This doesn't apply in the text submenus.
	- Pixel grid now has a submenu, where you can adjust the size or remove it
	- Positioning now has a submenu, where you can set the positioning type and fine-tune the offset up to half a block in either direction.
	- Text has a series of submenus, allowing you to edit or delete existing text objects and add new ones. (You can now fix those annoying typos!!)
	- Adjusting the size of a pixel grid will now keep the original grid - either stretching/compressing the image, or cropping/adding blank space.

Caveats:
	- When editing text, the text preview is offset by half a "pixel" to the right. This is a scaling issue, and edited text will still draw where it originally was (unless you move it)
	- Recipes aren't working ideally (they aren't shapeless for pen recolouring, and the base pen only accepts white wool. Blame the recipe system, it'll just take a bit of time to fix)
	- For reasons unknown, underline and strikeout formatting isn't always rendering in the UI (but occasionally does). It'll still render in world just fine though.
	- Text can be drawn outside of the 1x1 grid. If the block itself can't be seen, the floating text won't render. I intentionally didn't limit text to the 1x1 grid, but this render bug is a side effect.
	If you don't like the bug, don't write text outside of the grid!

TO-DO:
	- Magic Pen + UI
	- New brushes
	- Configurable offsetting
	- Configurable right-click actions
	- Transparency
	- Pixel drawing UI
	- Locking (better functionality/more testing)
	- Import JSON

	- In-game cloning of art
	- Text scale
	- Premade shapes
	- Draw game objects
	- Backdrop block

	- Import/Export website




Goals for fully editable artblock:
- One backdrop block (panel behind everything taking an existing block's texture)
- List of drawn objects
- List of item/blocks drawn
- Bool for each layer for fullbright texture

- Option for position (64th extruded, flush with block, attach to block)
- Bool for edit lock
